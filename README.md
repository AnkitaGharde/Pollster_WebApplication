# Pollster_WebApplication
We will create a pollster (voting system) web application using Django. This application will conduct a series of questions along with many choices. A user will be allowed to give voting for that question by selecting a choice. Based on the answer the total votes will be calculated and it will be displayed to the user. Users can also check the result of the total votes for specific questions on the website directly. We will also build the admin part of this project. Admin user will be allowed to add questions and manage questions in the application.
